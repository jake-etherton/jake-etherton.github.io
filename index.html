            <p>
                I'm a first-year Information Technology major at Ozarks Technical Community College aiming to become a system administrator. 

                Classes I've Taken:
                Intro to Programming: Utilized C# language with a team to build basic programs such as a calculator and library database.

                Web Site Development: Used HTML and CSS to build websites including one for a real client. 

                Technology/ Digital Literacy: Learned the different functions and uses for Microsoft Office programs. 

                Past Experience: 
                I have two years of experience working in retail and aim to break into the IT field soon. During my free time, I have built a custom PC and helped others when building theirs.
